	<script src="short.js" async></script>
	<!-- 
		async make our javascript file downloads at the same time
		as our html file its not being blocked and then once our file are 
		downloaded they execute or run straight away and during that phase 
		our html is blocked from being passed as you can see, but once our 
		file have been executed then we resume the passing of our html 
		until the file is ready. so, the difference between async and loading
		in our files plainly is that with async our javascript files download
		at the same time as our html its only during the execution phase of 
		our javascript that our html is blocked. so, already then we can see 
		that there's advantage using async over plainly loading in our files
		if we take a look at our files " long " and " short ".
		short.js being the smaller file will probably load and execute first 
		here another important thing to know about async. 
		async works on a load first run first basis so soon as the script 
		is downloaded it will execute or run straigh away. 

		====================================
			ASYNC DOESNT CARE ABOUT ORDER
		====================================

		good use case for async would be something like an analysis tool such as
		google analytics. such a file has not added value for the frontend user so 
		async will be ideal for performance and security reasons 
	-->
	<script src="long.js" defer></script>
	<!-- 
		defer just like async, our files are downloaded at the same time as the 
		passing of our html. the loading of html is not being blocked and the 
		difference with defer the execution  of our file is actually deferred hence
		the name defer until after our html has been passed and is ready. 
		once is ready our javascript file executes. so, our html is never blocked. 
		its free continue passing until its ready and the other key difference would 
		defer is that unlike async the relative order of our files is kept so even 
		if short.js is smaller file, probably loads first because the order of our 
		script has long js first once they're both downloaded then during execution 
		process, long.js will be executed first and then short.js 

		=========================================
			DEFER RESPECTS THE RELATIVE ORDER
		=========================================

		this make defer the attribute of choice when scripts defend on each other to 
		work and run
